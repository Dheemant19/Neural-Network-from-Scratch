# Neural-Network-from-Scratch

I have attempted to make a neural network from scratch without using libraries like tensorflow and pytorch. This [tutorial](https://medium.com/@waadlingaadil/learn-to-build-a-neural-network-from-scratch-yes-really-cac4ca457efc) from Medium helped me understand how neural networks actually function behind the scenes.

The [diabetes.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set) dataset is taken from Kaggle.

The network achieved a 0.8168 F1-score (macro average) and an accuracy of 83.3% on the validation set.
