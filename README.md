# Neural-Network-from-Scratch

I have attempted to make a neural network from scratch without using libraries like tensorflow and pytorch. 

The diabetes.csv dataset is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set

The network achieved a 0.8168 F1-score (macro average) and an accuracy of 83.3% on the validation set.
